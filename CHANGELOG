Version 4.0.2 - Oct 2013

 * Fix minor error with 1.2 connections. Add basic unit tests for 1.0, and 1.2


Version 4.0.1 - Oct 2013
 
 * Remove the 'transform' method/functionality, as this never went into the official spec. Clients who still want this should implement     themselves, using a listener (see https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/blob/master/stomp/test/misc_test.py for an example)
 * Add support for STOMP 1.2 line endings
 * Enforce "host" header on 1.2 connect requests (note: should be enforced on 1.1 connections, but it seems rabbitmq connections
   fail if host is set)


Version 4.0.0 - Oct 2013

 * Separate protocol from transport mechanism, to improve the ability to support multiple protocol versions. Note: constructor
   args are changing accordingly.
 * Add initial support for STOMP 1.2
 * Moved username and passcode params out of constructor and into the connect method. The basic connection process is therefore now:
 
     > conn = stomp.Connection([('localhost', 61613)])
     > conn.start()
     > conn.connect('admin', 'password', wait=True)


Version 3.1.6 - Sep 2013

 * Integrate fix for threading primitives issue (http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/issues/detail?id=53)
 * Add vhost constructor arg 
 * Change cli to __main__ (so you can run `python stomp` rather than `python stomp/cli.py`)
 * Integrate interrupt patch (http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/issues/detail?id=48)
 * Change test hosts and ports so that they're provided from the setup.py file
