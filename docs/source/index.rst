Stomp.py |release| documentation
================================

Stomp.py was created by `Jason R Briggs <http://jasonrbriggs.com>`_ and contributed to by a number of fine folks (see `here <http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/intro.html#contributors>`_ for more info). You can view outstanding issues, and find further info, on the `Github project page <http://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py>`_.  Unit test coverage reports can be found `here <http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/htmlcov/>`_.

NOTE: the examples in this documentation are largely written using version 1.1 of the stomp protocol: `<http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html>`_. Please check the `API documentation <http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/stomp.html#module-stomp.protocol>`_ for protocols 1.0 or 1.2, if you need to use a different version.
