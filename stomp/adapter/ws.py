        hosts fails.
    :param float reconnect_sleep_increase: factor by which the sleep delay is increased after
        each connection attempt. For example, 0.5 means
        to wait 50% longer than before the previous attempt,
        1.0 means wait twice as long, and 0.0 means keep
        the delay constant.

        the time determined using the previous parameters)
        between connection attempts in order to avoid
        stampeding. For example, a value of 0.1 means to wait
        an extra 0%-10% (randomly determined) of the delay
